    <p>This is the About page. You may modify the following file to customize its content:</p>

    <code><?= __FILE__ ?></code>
    <repository> should be the name of a remote repository as passed to git-fetch[1].
        <refspec> can name an arbitrary remote ref (for example, the name of a tag) or even a collection of refs with
            corresponding remote-tracking branches (e.g., refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*), but usually it is the
            name of a branch in the remote repository.
